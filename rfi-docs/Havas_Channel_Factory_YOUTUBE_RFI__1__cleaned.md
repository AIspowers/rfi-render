Creators often mislabel their content, or no category on YouTube exists to properly categorize. For example, there is no kids content category, despite a significant amount of kid related content on YouTube.

|          nan | 10           | Customisation: granularity of inclusion/exclusion customisation | We can get incredibly custom - down to the keyword level in terms of what you want included or excluded. For example, we had a client that wanted Channels/Videos relating to Star Wars - so we were able to build that list in our ViewIQ technology. Aside from the standard 4As/GARM Safety/Suitability parameters available when building lists, we also have Exclusion built into our process in 2 ways. The first is to input excluded terms, video URLs or Channel URLs when we are building a list (for example, a client wanted to be around movie content but NOT Harry Potter. We were able to generate a list that included Movie Channels/Videos that did not currently mention Harry Potter). The second part is to also use these same terms and URLs in the live exclusion/block list input into DV360 or Google Ads (e.g. if a Channel on our list created a video mentioning Harry Potter, by having those terms in the live exclusion block list, we wouldn't run on that new video).                                                                     |

To date, we track ~500M videos and ~3M channels across YouTube. Once data is retrieved, we typically score a new channel and its videos within 24-48 hours. Additionally, all already tracked channels are refreshed constantly and always stay refreshed within a 30 day window. After data is collected and review, we provide a suitability ranking in 4 levels; Unsuitable, Low Suitable, Medium Suitable, and Suitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

As part of ViewIQ, we have a few ways to help clients find recommendations. #1 is our tool "Review" where clients can input their campaign's channel/video delivery list, set parameters for performance/suitability/language/etc., and receive recommendations for both new channels/videos to add and what channels/videos to remove. #2 is our Ads Analyzer tool where clients can analyze performance by campaign/line item, ad group, device, demo and more to quickly be able to see what is performing below or above average. . Building off of these tools and with our clients' feedback based on their needs, we are also beta testing our Auto-Optimization AI tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This includes data, such as subscribers, categories, descriptions, and titles. Once collected, we currently use machine learning algorithms to review YouTube data and determine the items such as language make-up or suitability of videos and, at a later date, sentiment. This enables Channel Factory teams and clients to quickly apply campaign target segments to build a refined list of channels and/or videos on YouTube.

Once data is retrieved, we typically assign a level to a new channel and its videos within 24 to 48 hours. Additionally, all already tracked channels are refreshed constantly and always stay refreshed within a 30 day window. After data is collected and reviewed, we provide a suitability ranking in 4 levels: Unsuitable, Low Suitable, Medium Suitable, and Suitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Uplifting content can be broad, but it makes the user feel good); Tells the Truth (Conscious content tells the truth and is based on fact. Conscious content makes quality, fact-driven information and sources available); Diversity & Identity (Conscious content can be across any community, conversation, region or creator that is contributing to a more inclusive digital ecosystem. Diversity of languages is important to consider in addition to marginalized groups)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

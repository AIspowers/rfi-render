We believe brand suitability is a tailored version of brand safety that differs per brand. ie Heineken wants to exclude driving and car content as they are an alcohol brand, where car manufacturers like BMW are targeting this kind of content actively. We use advanced proprietary tools like ViewIQ to ensure ads are placed in brand-safe environments, emphasizing positive content alignment and supporting diverse creators. Our inclusion-based approach moves beyond simple exclusion methods, allowing brands to engage meaningfully with growth audiences. With real-time AI-driven adjustments, our platform dynamically adapts to evolving content trends, ensuring continuous safety and relevance for our clients' campaigns. | nan          |

Further tailoring includes over +300k keywords in over 49 languages for multi-modal analysis that works on meta data, descriptions, titles, audio transcripts together with analyzing content quality, sentiment and computer vision. Another lever that is available is historical performance on a channel level including, not limited to, minimum video count, last upload date, impressions, view rates, vtrs, ctrs and costs delivered. This allows us to create custom channel and video lists fully tailored for both scalability and cost-efficiency. The process of creating the brand suitability lists is then refreshed dynamically and run through the methodology multiple times a day to ensure trending suitable content is included and anything non-performing is excluded. |              |

By categorizing spoken content, they go beyond tags to determine whether specific phrases or topics align with a brand’s suitability requirements. This includes identifying nuances that could otherwise be overlooked by basic metadata analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |              |

We use a Multimodal based approach (Keyword, audio, image-based models) which help categorize content by identifying common terms related to sensitive subjects or brand-safe topics. Our extensive coverage goes beyond 49+ languages, the system filters content dynamically, ensuring it aligns with brand safety requirements across different marketsI models classify content into broad topics by examining central themes, channel attributes, and video-level signals. This involves semantic grouping into IAB-standard categories, which are particularly useful for topic-based advertising (e.g., "sports," "beauty"). These topic classifications ensure ads appear within suitable and contextually relevant environments, aligning with brand themes .                                                                                                          | nan          |

This continuous updating process ensures that brands avoid sudden unsuitability issues associated with new content, thus reducing false negatives (allowing unsuitable content) and false positives (unnecessarily blocking suitable content)lusion Lists and Language Filtering**: Using extensive exclusion lists covering 150,000 keywords across 49 languages, the system effectively reduces inaccuracies by screening specific terms and language nuances that could be misinterpreted in brand safety contexts . Human Oversight for Sensitive Categories: For content that may involve complex cultural or contextual nuances, human reviewers conduct an additional layer of vetting. This helps catch subtle issues that AI models might miss, especially in high-risk categories where automated systems alone could produce false negatives . | nan          |

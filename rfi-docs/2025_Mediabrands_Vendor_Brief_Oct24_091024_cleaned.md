Our approach is about fluidity
Think ecosystem
With Outcome Based Planning, there’s 
a genuine need for an Outcome Based 
Trading mentality
Fluidity needs to be built into our 
partnerships to facilitate:
•Movement of client spend
•Changes to format types / channels
•Test & learn opportunities
Rate / CPM efficiencies are important 
to best showcase your assets in an 
OBP worldFurther rationalisation
Gold, Silver, Bronze tiers remain in 
place 
Partnerships across each tier will be 
reassessed for 2025
Expect further rationalisation to 
happenValue framework
Value frameworks to be established
Magna Media Trials study 
opportunities to be evaluated to 
support agency priorities and upper 
funnel branding – in 2025, we’re 
aiming for fewer, bigger, better 
Media consumption & impact 
measures – build in 3 questions to any 
client studies you conduct on our 
behalf to help bolster our planning

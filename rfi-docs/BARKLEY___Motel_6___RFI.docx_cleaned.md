Promoting

a

this
 
is
 
why
 
we
 
started
 
The
 
Conscious
 
Project
 
(https://channelfactory.com/consumer-sentiment-and-conscious-advertising/)
 
mission..
 
We
 
believe
 
the
 
media
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
force
 
for
 
good,
 
and
 
that
 
by
 
shining
 
a
 
light
 
on
 
the
 
positivity
 
in
 
the
 
world
 
with
 
happy
 
stories,
 
human
 
interactions,
 
important
 
issues,
 
real
 
journalism
 
etc.
 
we
 
can
 
start
 
to
 
heal.
 
Channel
 
Factory
 
has
 
a
 
multi-faceted
 
approach
 
to
 
spreading
 
positivity:
 
from
 
reviewing
 
our
 
platform
 
with
 
a
 
human
 
lens
 
into
 
diversity
 
&
 
inclusion,
 
to
 
ensuring
 
we
 
are
 
monetizing
 
more
 
positive
 
content
 
across
 
the
 
web,
 
to
 
investing
 
in
 
diverse
 
voices.
   
 
 
ENSURE
 
WE
 
ARE
 
NOT
 
EXCLUDING
 
As
 
part
 
of
 
our
 
initial
 
effort
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
inclusive
 
media
 
approach,
 
we
 
conducted
 
an
 
audit
 
of
 
our
 
platform
 
in
 
49
 
different
 
languages,
 
using
 
native
 
language
 
vetters
 
and
 
a
 
committee
 
of
 
trusted
 
peers.
 
The
 
goal
 
was
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
we
 
were
 
not
 
inadvertently
 
excluding
 
words,
 
phrases
 
or
 
languages
 
that
 
could
 
leave
 
out
 
certain
 
groups,
 
and
 
make
 
changes
 
where
 
appropriate.
 
 
BUILD
 
INCLUSIVITY
 
&
 
REPRESENTATION
 
INTO
 
OUR
 
APPROACH
 
We
 
began
 
to
 
create
 
more
 
thoughtful
 
and
 
diverse
 
targeting
 
strategies
 
made
 
up
 
of
 
channels
 
and
 
conversations
 
that
 
highlight
 
certain
 
voices
 
like
 
LGBTQ+,
 
Black
 
creators,
 
LatinX
 
creators,
 
etc
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
ALL
 
voices
 
are
 
represented
 
in
 
each
 
campaign
 
we
 
create,
 
not
 
just
 
some.
